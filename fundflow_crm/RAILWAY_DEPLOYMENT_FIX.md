# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Health Check Timeout**: Reduced timeout from 300s to 60s and simplified health check endpoint
2. **Database Initialization**: Made database and config initialization non-blocking to prevent startup failures
3. **Better Logging**: Added startup script with detailed logging for debugging
4. **Resilient Startup**: App will start even if database/config fails, falling back to mock data

## Files Changed:

- `railway.json`: Updated health check timeout and start command
- `backend/main.py`: Made startup more resilient and updated health check
- `Dockerfile`: Added better logging and health checks
- `backend/start.sh`: New startup script with debugging info

## Next Steps:

1. **Push to Git**: Commit and push all changes to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Railway**: Trigger a new deployment
3. **Check Logs**: Monitor the deployment logs for the new startup messages
4. **Verify Health Check**: Once deployed, test the `/health` endpoint

## Environment Variables to Set in Railway:

Make sure these are configured in your Railway project:

- `PORT`: Should be automatically set by Railway
- `MONGODB_URL`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string (optional - will use mock DB if not set)
- `DATABASE_NAME`: Your database name (defaults to "fundflow_crm")
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`: Will be set automatically by Railway

## Testing Commands:

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Basic health check (should work even without DB)
- `GET /health/detailed` - Detailed health check with DB status
- `GET /` - Root endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/database/status` - Database connection status

## If Still Failing:

1. Check Railway logs for the startup messages
2. Verify the PORT environment variable is being set correctly
3. Check if the health check endpoint is responding
4. Try the `/health/detailed` endpoint to see database status
