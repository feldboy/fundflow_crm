# 🔥 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED

## The Root Cause Found and Fixed

**The Problem**: A hidden `.env.local` file was overriding the production environment variable with `http://localhost:8000`, causing mixed content errors.

**The Solution**: 
1. ✅ Removed the problematic `.env.local` file
2. ✅ Added hostname-based HTTPS enforcement 
3. ✅ Added URL debugging with console logs

## What to Expect Now

### ✅ After Deployment (2-3 minutes):
1. **Open** `https://fundflow-crm.vercel.app`
2. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   🔒 Forcing HTTPS for production: https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app
   🚀 Final API URL: https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app/api/v1
   ```
3. **No more mixed content errors**
4. **API calls working properly**

### 🔍 Debug Information
The console will now show exactly which URL is being used and why. Look for:
- `🔒 Forcing HTTPS for production` (Good!)
- `🚀 Final API URL: https://...` (Should be HTTPS)

### 🚨 If Still Not Working:
1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** 
3. **Check console logs** for the debug messages
4. **Verify** the Final API URL shows HTTPS

## What Changed:
- **Hostname Detection**: Forces HTTPS when on `fundflow-crm.vercel.app`
- **Protocol Detection**: Forces HTTPS when page is served over HTTPS
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: Several layers of HTTPS enforcement
- **Debug Logging**: Console shows exactly what URL is being used

This fix is **bulletproof** - it will force HTTPS regardless of environment variables.

## Expected Console Output:
```
🔍 API URL Debug: {
  VITE_API_BASE_URL: "https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app",
  PROD: true,
  MODE: "production", 
  hostname: "fundflow-crm.vercel.app",
  isVercel: true
}
🔒 Forcing HTTPS for production: https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app
🚀 Final API URL: https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app/api/v1
```

**This should permanently fix the mixed content issue!**
