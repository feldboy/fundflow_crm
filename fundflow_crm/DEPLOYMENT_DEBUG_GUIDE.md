# 🚨 Immediate Deployment Debug Guide

## Current Status
Your deployment has been triggered with debugging tools. Here's how to verify the fix:

## 📋 Steps to Verify HTTPS Fix

### 1. Wait for Vercel Deployment
- Check your Vercel dashboard for deployment completion
- Should take 2-5 minutes

### 2. Open Your Deployed Site
- Go to `https://fundflow-crm.vercel.app`
- You should see a red **API URL Debug** component at the top of the dashboard

### 3. Check the API URL Debug Component
The red debug box will show:
- ✅ **If VITE_API_BASE_URL is set correctly**
- ✅ **If the computed API URL starts with `https://`**
- ❌ **If it's still using HTTP (shows the problem)**

### 4. If Still HTTP, Set Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app
   VITE_API_VERSION = v1
   ```
3. Set for: **Production, Preview, Development**
4. Redeploy your project

## 🔧 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- API URL Debug shows: `https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app/api/v1`
- No mixed content errors in browser console
- API calls work without CORS errors
- Dashboard loads data properly

### ❌ Problem Indicators:
- API URL Debug shows: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` (fallback)
- Still getting mixed content errors
- VITE_API_BASE_URL shows "NOT SET"

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

### Test API directly:
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://fundflow-crm.vercel.app" https://fundflowcrm-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Check CORS:
```bash
./quick_cors_test.sh
```

## 📞 Next Steps if Still Broken
1. Screenshot the API URL Debug component
2. Check browser console for exact error messages
3. Verify Vercel environment variables are set correctly
4. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

## 🎯 The Root Cause
The mixed content error means your frontend is still trying to make HTTP requests to your HTTPS-served page. The debug component will show exactly what URL is being used.
